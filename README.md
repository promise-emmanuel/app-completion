# Overview
As a software developer, I aim to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and natural language processing by building tools that streamline complex task. One of such tool is a summarization app which uses openAI's  large language model to generate concise, meaningful summaries of any given text.
This app allows users to quickly grasp the essential points of a document without needing to read the entire content.
The purpose of this software is to provide users with a tool that can efficiently summarize articles, research papers, or any text-based content.

# Development Environment

- **Libraries/Framework:** The main library used is the OpenAI API, which is responsible for generating the text summaries. The openai python package was integrated to communicate with the GPT 4o-mini model. Flask was used to render the frontend of the app. 

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Programming Language:** Python
